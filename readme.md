# SpinRyte-THUGPRO

## Description

For those struggling to spin their tricks the correct direction in the name of S T Y L E. 
Uses OpenCV for object detection and TKinter for drawing arrows on screen. 

Warning: You might very well need to adjust the draw arrow function to be better suited towards your PC's resolution. right_x and left_x will need to be adjusted. 

Second warning: I have not tested this with anything other than the default Thug Pro theme, may be issues with other themes because of the font. In that case just snip your screen with new screenshots of each stance.
